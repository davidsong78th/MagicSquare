Program/Project 1 written in C

Dr. Richard Goodrum

- A multiprocess C program which uses getdomainname, gethostname, and uname to get and display system information about machine. 

- It uses pipes to communicate a nine-digit, text formatted value from the client to the server. 

- The server is then required to verify whether or not the sequence supplied represents a magic square and provide a T/F response.

- The multiprocess application was created using the fork() system call.

# To Execute
